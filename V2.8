TOOL EVALUATIONS



Zenodo vs. Dryad:



- Zenodo: Free, 50GB limit, over 3 million uploads and ~1M
users (2025).[^1] Ideal for quick, versatile uploads (e.g., AI models). Lacks
curation.



- Dryad: Curated, 300GB limit, ~50,000 datasets (2025), fees
for >50GB.[^2] Suited for peer-reviewed data (e.g., ecology).



 



OpenReview vs. Traditional Peer Review:



- OpenReview: Public, ~10K papers (2025), fosters
collaboration (e.g., AI research).[^3] May expose flaws early.



- Traditional: Anonymous, reduces bias, widely accepted
(e.g., medical research).



 



AI & COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS



Primer for Novices: AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools
involve machine learning models that analyze data patterns. Computational tools
like Jupyter allow interactive coding without advanced setup. Quantum computing
(e.g., Qiskit) simulates quantum mechanics for complex problems—start with
basics if new to programming.

To create a polished, publication-ready PDF layout (with
automatic TOC, headers/footers, link tagging, and accessibility features), I
recommend using Markdown-to-PDF tools like Pandoc. If you’d like, provide
confirmation, and I can generate a Markdown version optimized for conversion or
edit the content further. I can also create a “Reviewer’s Summary Sheet” as a
separate document—let me know!
